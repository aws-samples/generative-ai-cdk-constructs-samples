        This sample application harnesses the power of generative AI to generate multi-lingual descriptions for uploaded images.
        Leveraging the [Document Summarization](https://github.com/awslabs/generative-ai-cdk-constructs/tree/main/src/patterns/gen-ai/aws-summarization-appsync-stepfn) construct,
        This sophisticated solution employs the advanced capabilities of Anthropic's Claude 3 with Amazon Bedrock to generate comprehensive and accurate image descriptions across multiple languages.

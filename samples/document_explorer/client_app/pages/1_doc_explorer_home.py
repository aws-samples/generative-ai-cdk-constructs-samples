        The Sample Generative AI Application demonstrates how to build end-to-end solutions leveraging AWS services and the [Generative AI Constructs library](https://github.com/awslabs/generative-ai-cdk-constructs).

        It includes examples of key components needed in generative AI applications:

        - [Data Ingestion Pipeline](https://github.com/awslabs/generative-ai-cdk-constructs/tree/main/src/patterns/gen-ai/aws-rag-appsync-stepfn-opensearch): Ingests documents, converts them to text, and stores them in a knowledge base for retrieval. This enables long context window approaches.

        - [Document Summarization](https://github.com/awslabs/generative-ai-cdk-constructs/tree/main/src/patterns/gen-ai/aws-summarization-appsync-stepfn): Summarizes PDF documents leveraging Large Language Models like Anthropic Claude V2 via Amazon Bedrock. 

        - [Question Answering](https://github.com/awslabs/generative-ai-cdk-constructs/tree/main/src/patterns/gen-ai/aws-qa-appsync-opensearch): Answers natural language questions by retrieving relevant documents from the knowledge base and leveraging Large Language Models.

        By providing reusable constructs following AWS best practices, this app enables quickly building custom generative AI apps on AWS. The constructs abstract complexity of orchestrating AWS services like Lambda, OpenSearch, Step Functions, Bedrock, etc.

        Here is the architecture diagram of the sample application:
